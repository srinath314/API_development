# API_development
 This FastAPI app serves a machine learning model via a /predict endpoint. The endpoint accepts input parameters (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) and returns corresponding outputs (output1, output2). Access to the endpoint requires an API key, which needs to be passed as a header (X-API-Key). The API key is validated using a custom dependency (verify_api_key). The machine learning model prediction logic is a placeholder in this code, and you should replace it with your actual model prediction logic. The app is run using Uvicorn server with automatic reloading for development purposes.
